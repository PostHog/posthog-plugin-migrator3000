# PostHog Plugin: Migrator 3000 

This plugin allows you to migrate events from one PostHog instance to another. You can migrate between self-hosted instances, or from a self-hosted instance to PostHog Cloud (and vice-versa).

**Please note that this plugin will only migrate events and objects derived from events such as persons. Dashboards, insights, feature flags, etc. will not be migrated.**
